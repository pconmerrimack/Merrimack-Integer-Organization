This page serves as a repository for the projects currently being created by Patrick Connolly for the CSC6301 (Software Design and Documentation) class at Merrimack College. Within this page you will find the projects LinkedList Project, and StackGenerator Project. Both of these projects seek to implement a mechanism of organizing integers into sorted lists, either as a LinkedList or Stack respectively.

LinkedList Project Contains the following:
  LinkedList Diagram: A class diagram for the LinkedListGenerator Class
  
  LinkedListGenerator.Java: Java program implementing a method for sorting Integers given by user input into a Sorted LinkedList.
  
  README.md : Document outlining the usage of LinkedListGenerator.Java

  LinkedListGenerator.html : Javadocs providing documentation of LinkedListGenerator.java.

StackGenerator Project Contains the following:
  
  StackGenerator Diagram + Plan: A class diagram for the StackGenerator Class, as well as documentation of the plannning for maintenance of the program.     
  Specifically, the plan for updating the program to create a sorted Stack, rather than a LinkedList.
  
  StackGenerator.Java: Java program implementing a method for sorting Integers given by user input into a Sorted Stack. 
 
  README.md : Document outlining the usage of StackGenerator.Java

  StackGenerator.html : Javadocs providing documentation of StackGenerator.java
